Highly customizable propkill script

- I've had multiple requests so this was made for the community. There has never been any fully customizable propkill script before.
- Gives you the ability to adjust colors, switch between multiple materials/sizes/designs for various visuals.
- I've also been asked to implement a few of the old propkill scripts features (which arent mine) in the script.
- This is NOT a cheat.
